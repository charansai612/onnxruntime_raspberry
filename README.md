# OnnxRuntime For RaspberryPi

## Project Description

Compiling onnxruntime for Raspberry Pi can be a time-consuming and challenging task. However, to simplify the process for you, I have attached a pre-compiled Python wheel file specifically for Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Python 3.9.x and 1.25.0 Numpy headers.

The onnxruntime library is a powerful open-source engine for executing machine learning models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. By providing this pre-compiled wheel file, I aim to save you the hassle of going through the lengthy compilation process on your Raspberry Pi device.

To use the pre-compiled wheel, simply follow the installation instructions provided in the [Installation](#installation) section below. This will enable you to quickly set up onnxruntime on your Raspberry Pi 3B+ environment without the need for compiling from source.

## Installation

To install the pre-compiled Python wheel file for onnxruntime on your Raspberry Pi 3B+ device, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Locate the pre-compiled Python wheel file (usually with a `.whl` extension).
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the wheel file is located.
5. Run the following command to install the wheel:

```bash
   pip install onnxruntime-1.15.1-cp39-cp39-linux_armv7l.whl
```
